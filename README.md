# angel.co companies list scraping
Unfortunatelly oficial provided [API](https://angel.co/api) by angel.co was shut downed.

This script allows you parse list of the companies provided by angel.co from the page [All Companies](https://angel.co/companies)
and save it to .csv file.
Personally I was interested only in a few columns however it wouldn't be hard to add or remove desirable columns.

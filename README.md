Unfortunately official provided [API](https://angel.co/api) by angel.co was shut down.

This script allows you parse the list of the companies provided by angel.co from the page [All Companies](https://angel.co/companies)
and save it to .csv file.
Personally, I was interested only in a few columns however it wouldn't be hard to add or remove desirable columns.
